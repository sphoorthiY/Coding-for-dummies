This website has 2 webpages the user can access.
One where user can enter the programming language they want to learn and using openai api it returns how to learn the language step by step and some resources which are helpful. 
In the other webpage it generates a programming challenge for the requested language and asks user to enter the code and again using openai api it cross checks the code.
